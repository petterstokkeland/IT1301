## Introduction

Money Spender is a multifaceted application built on a four-module structure, aligning with a three-tier architecture that distinctively separates core logic, user interface (UI), data storage, and server communication. Managed by Maven, the project ensures a smooth integration of these modules, facilitating effective collaboration between the core logic, UI, data handling, and server interactions. This strategic arrangement of modules in Money Spender offers users an all-encompassing tool for efficient financial management.

## Modules

Money Spender is designed following a robust three-tier architecture:

- **[Core:](money-spender/core/readme.md)** This layer houses the foundational logic and data structures critical to the application's functionality.

- **[Restapi](money-spender/server/readme.md)** Managing data storage and user authentication, this layer plays a pivotal role in securely storing and retrieving essential information.

- **[Persistence:](money-spender/persistence/readme.md)** Managing data storage and user authentication, this layer plays a pivotal role in securely storing and retrieving essential information.

- **[User Interface (UI):](money-spender/ui/readme.md)** Responsible for the user-facing components and interactions, the UI layer ensures a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Building with Maven

Our project employs Maven, a robust build automation tool, to manage dependencies and streamline the build process. Specifically, the following Maven plugins are utilized:

- [**maven-compiler-plugin:**](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/) This plugin manages the compilation of Java source code, ensuring that it is compatible with the specified Java version.

- [**maven-surefire-plugin:**](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/) This plugin is responsible for executing unit tests, aiding in validating the correctness of our codebase.

- [**javafx-maven-plugin:**](https://github.com/openjfx/javafx-maven-plugin) To facilitate the use of JavaFX within the project, this plugin provides essential configuration and support for JavaFX applications.

- [**junit**:](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java. It is used to write and run repeatable tests.

- [**jacoco-maven-plugin:**](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco) We implemented jacoco to generate code coverage reports. This helps us to see how much of our code is covered by tests and find areas that need better testing. You can find the reports in the folder target/site/jacoco in every module after building the project or `mvn verify`.

- [**maven-checkstyle-plugin:**](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io) We implemented Checkstyle for ensure that our code follows a set of coding standards. This helps us to write code that is easier to read and maintain. The standard we use is the eclipse-java-google-style.xml. We added this file in config foldere in money-spender folder. When we run the command mvn verify, checkstyle will check if our code follows the rules in this file. We will get warnings and violations if our code does not follow the rules.

- [**spotbugs-maven-plugin:**](https://spotbugs.github.io) We implemented SpotBugs to our project to help us catch mistakes and problems in our code. When we run the `mvn verify` command, SpotBugs checks our code for errors. If it finds any, it tells us about them during the building process. This makes our code more reliable and secure by spotting common mistakes and security problems.

- [**spring-boot-maven-plugin:**](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/) The Spring Boot Maven Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Apache Maven. It allows us to run Spring Boot applications, generate build information and start your Spring Boot application prior to running integration tests.

## System Requirements
